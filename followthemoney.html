          <p class="bigText">Introduction <br></p>
          <p class="normalText">Follow the money is a sleek and simple mobile VR
            application. Users must navigate through a maze, collect a key,
            and unlock a gate to reach the end. To move around the maze the user
            rotates his head and uses his headset’s trigger to teleport via waypoints.
             The waypoints are placed all around the map and do not lead the user
             directly to the end of the maze. However, by following the money the
             user will reach the end in just a few clicks. <br> <br></p>

           <p class="bigText">Story of the process <br></p>
           <p class="normalText">First the maze needed to be modeled. Next was to
             decide the maze’s path. After a few iterations on both I arrived at a
             maze of moderate difficulty (1-3 minutes to complete). </p>

           <p class="bigText">User testing outcomes and iteration<br></p>
           <p class="normalText">Receiving user feedback was crucial to understanding
             common hurdles to VR navigation. My maze is pretty simple, but poor
             design initially made it a pain to play. <br>
              <strong>Lesson 1: VR noobs</strong>
              <ul>
                <li class="normalText">The game was given to people through a google cardboard with
                  my phone inside. Mobile VR with a cardboard only has 3 Degrees of
                  Freedom, so no positional tracking. That didn’t stop users from
                  attempting to navigate the maze by physically walking around.</li>
                <li class="normalText">Solution: I included a set of directions at the beginning to get
                  them going.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="normalText"><strong>Lesson 2: Where’s the gate?<br></strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li class="normalText">“Ugh I just keep moving in circles” was a common remark. Once
                  the user stepped out of the maze they had no idea what to do.
                  Following my deceptively placed waypoints they just kept on scaling
                  the perimeter of the outside of the maze. The final waypoint was
                  too close to the gate for them to see it.</li>
                <li class="normalText">Solution: I adjusted the position of the final waypoint and
                  adjusted the color of the gate and key to be similar to the
                  waypoints. Users could intuitively tell that interacting with
                  these objects is promising.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="normalText"><strong>Lesson 3: Didn’t follow the money <br></strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li class="normalText">Some users never found out where the money was located so they
                  couldn’t follow the trail. I stuck to a realistic metaphor and
                  placed the coins on the ground. To find them the user must arch his
                  neck downward.</li>
                <li class="normalText">Solution: I realize this is uncomfortable for the user, but the
                  majority of them didn’t complain. And besides it provides a healthy
                  level of difficulty. So I kept it how it is. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="bigText">Conclusion <br></p>
            <p class="normalText">VR, in terms of adoption, is in its infancy.
              People don’t use it often enough to understand how to interact with
              objects or navigate an environment. However even with these obstacles
              people just love being immersed in an environment. VR is a lot like
              love: There is only so much one can explain through pictures
              and words. This project was many of my users’ first experience with VR
              and my first experience as a VR developer. And just like them I can’t
              wait to have more. </p>
