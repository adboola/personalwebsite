          <p class="normalText">
            Packed away in our minds are memories we love and cherish,
            so I wanted to create a way for you to experience them in the most
            intimate way yet. A place for you to go to within your mind.
            Your Mind Palace.
            <br> <br>
            Innovation in the photos space has been limited to the hosting side
            (i.e. Google Photos, Amazon Drive, iCloud). There has been no
            innovation in photo viewing. By making the first 2D photo viewer in
            Virtual Reality I can show more photos at full-size than any other
            platform. Users are surrounded by their photos and can interact
            with them in a unique, but natural way.

          <p class="normalText">Mind Palace VR pulls the most recent photos
             from your Camera Gallery. A spherical grid is dynamically
             generated, positioning and angling each photo to be centered
             in your line of view. Hovering over a photo enlarges it. Clicking
             on it moves the user smoothly towards it. The user can then choose
             to move on to another photo or back to the original position. </p>

           <p class="bigText">Story of the process <br></p>
           <p class="normalText">A few weeks ago, my mind struggled to produce
             ideas for VR. Such a new field must be ripe with lucrative
             opportunities! I just couldn’t get past one idea: Photos for VR.
             Thus it began.

              <strong>Problem 1: Learning Unity</strong>
              <br>
              This first obstacle was easy to traverse. Udacity just opened a
              Virtual Reality Nanodegree which was essentially a glorified
              introduction to Unity. And it cost $200. I didn’t have $200 bucks.
               So I used their 1-week free trial + the Github student’s 4-week
               free trial. 4 + 1… carry the 3… 5 weeks total! Plenty of time.
               <br>
               Learn Unity - Check.

                <strong>Problem 2: Make a photosphere<br></strong>
                Virtual Reality development is unlike other platforms because
                of the math. 3D environments make UI design 3x as complicated.
                After a bit of math, a laser printed protractor (true story),
                and a couple days of struggle I figured it out. Noted the x,y,z
                positions and angles. Employed a nested for-loop to create the
                2D grid and voila - photosphere.

              <p class="normalText"><strong>Problem 3: User experience design
                <br></strong>
                VR design is largely uncharted territory. All the 2D paradigms
                can be thrown out.
                <br>
                The typical photo viewing app works as follows: show a grid of
                thumbnails of photos, the photo the user clicks on fills the
                screen, exit the full-screen photo, continue to search.
                <br>
                My app works like this: see all of the photos in the grid in
                full-res, upon fill the user’s view with
                the photo while maintaining the environment - so the user
                only has to glance around to see the other photos, allow the
                user to jump around the grid or view from a distance.
                <br>
                This design is totally unique. It keeps the user totally i
                mmersed and fully in-control. Plus it’s intuitive and quick to master.
                <br>
              </p>
              <p class="normalText"><strong>Problem 4: Size of the grid</strong><br>
                I initially had a 7x9 grid. 63 photos. That’s a lot. However
                the user had to tilt their head up-and-down to uncomfortable
                degrees. Vertical head movement, I learned, is limited while
                Horizontal head movement is not. So the grid was reduced to 5x7.
                The user would only have to slightly tilt their heads upwards or
                sideways to see all the photos.
                <br>

            <p class="bigText">Conclusion <br></p>
            <p class="normalText">After a combined total of 3 weeks of work and
              the help of a couple of friends, Mind Palace VR was launched in
              the Google Play Store. It also won Google’s Virtual Reality
              Challenge at Virginia Tech in the category “Most Marketable”.
              <br>
              Mind Palace has been the first innovative photo viewing
              application in a long time. Although it won’t be actively
               developed further (for now), I’m pumped to take my work in
               VR/AR/MR to the next level. Many a great experience have yet to
               be devised and I can’t wait to bring them to existence. </p>
